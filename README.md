# Random-password-generator

Description:

This website allows the user to generate a random password given their specifications. The browser will show a prompt once the user clicks the "generate password" button. Then they will be asked, how long their desired password will be. The prompt is already given restriction of a password with a length of no less than 8 characters and no more than 128 characters. Once they have specified the desired length then the user is asked what other characters they want included in their password. These specifications are: "Click OK to include special characters.", "Click OK to include numeric characters.", "Click OK to include lowercase characters." and "Click OK to include uppercase characters.". If none of the choices were selected then an alert will show saying that the user must choose at least one character to be used. Then when all the requirements are made then a random password will be generated in the text box.
